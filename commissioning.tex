\section{Commissioning Data Releases} \label{sect:commissioning}

Distributing commissioning data to the LSST data rights community brings the mutual benefits
of preparing the community for LSST data and giving the LSST team the opportunity to prepare
for efficient operations. This policy balancing
early science with the importance of ensuring fair access to LSST data for LSST Data Rights
holders is still being decided but we outline a likely scenario here.


\subsection{Alerts} \label{sect:alerts}
Early alert stream data will also be distributed, possibly with substantial latency, to
familiarize the community with the planned format and content of the alert stream.
At best-effort alert stream may be distributed around August 2021.


\subsection{ComCam Release - end 2020}
Currently ComCam ends  around August 2020 - allowing a few months for cleaning and documenting the
ComCam Images and source catalogs  could be available 3-6 months later hence by end of 2020 {\bf iff} the schedule holds and ComCam finishes mid 2020.

\subsection{Commissioning Full Camera  Release - end Q3 2021} \label{sect:cfc}
Currently commissioning of the Full Camera ends  around March 2021 before the mini surveys start.
Again allowing for clean up and documenting,  Images and source catalogs  could be available 3-6 months later around September 2021.

\subsection{Mini Surveys  Release - end 2021}
The Mini-Surveys ends  around August 2021 - they commence directly as commissioning the Full Camera Ends  hence this data release may be affected by preparations of the prior release \secref{sect:cfc}.
Hence, effort permitting,  Images and source catalogs from the mini surveys may be available by end of 2021.
