\subsection{Data Quality} \label{sect:qa}

The release of any data will be preceded by a set of quality checks done as part of science operations. Especially for initial data releases poor quality data may be held back even though all data will come with quality flags allowing end user filtering.

For commissioning data this
would be done in consultation with the commissioning team.
Data of adequate quality for early shared-risk scientific investigations will be
distributed.
